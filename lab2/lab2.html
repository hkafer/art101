					<p> Hey! My name is Hailey Kafer and I am a fourth year theater arts major!
						I have been performing since I was three years old and thrive off of creative projects.
						When it comes to computers, I know very little about coding or programming.
						I am looking forward to exploring New Media Art and incorporating it into my own art.
						My partner is Drew Vander Weele and he is also a fourth year theater arts major!
						His father deals a lot with software engineering, but he himself does not know much
						about computers. We are both excited to learn more! </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab assignment, my partner and I had to create a website by both editing the HTML and the CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A big problem that arose for me was that font would not change, no matter how many times I changed the code. So, I used WesBot and he helped me fix the problem! My code was not wrong but there was a code that was overriding it so Wesbot told me how to change it.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went very well for me. I feel like I understand the basics and it was really fun getting to play around with the website! I put a lot of energy into this assignment and I figured out how to make a fun border!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We both finished our websites and were able to make them look aesthetic and functional.</p>
