					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this assignment was to create a webpage that links all of the labs together. It was also about creating new files and figuring out how to move them around while coding. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A main issue that I had while coding was that my homepage index needed to just be in the art101 folder, not under any other tabs. WesBot told me to move it out and it fixed my issue.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a very difficult lab for me and took a lot of time. I struggled with getting my pictures to load, but I was able to figure it out and I am proud of my work.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> After a lot of trial and error, I was able to create a cohesive webpage that links together all my labs. </p>
