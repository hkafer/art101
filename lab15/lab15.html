  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p> I struggled a lot with this lab. My API was not linking properly and it seemed that every end point I tried would not work. Most of the websites that were linked in the lab did not work so I had to find other ones to use. My button was not working and it turns out it was an issue with the website.</p>
